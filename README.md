Big thanks to __Rxi__ on Github for the Love2d project on MS DOS. 
If you want to create love2d/LUA programs or games you can do it 
with the project (http://github.com/rxi/lovedos).

Also big thanks to __Jotapapel__ for sharing the most recent build, wich fixed the sound issues, without this I couldn't implement sounds.
